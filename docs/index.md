## About

Small business owners and freelancers may find it difficult to keep track of all of their clients.

CinnamonBun is an application that helps to keep a record of a large number of clients and business transactions, to allow business owners to focus more on their job and less on worrying about bookkeeping.

CinnanonBun comes with a beautiful Graphical User Interface (GUI) while being optimized for control via a Command Line Interface (CLI).
