### Project: CinnamonBun
Small business owners and freelancers may find it difficult to keep track of all their clients.

CinnamonBun is an application aimed at business owners to help managing their
clients with beautiful and minimalist User Interface (UI). CinnamonBun provides 
functionalities to store and manage client's information as well as their transactions.
By using CinnamonBun, users are able to manage clients' membership, tags, and tracking clients'
transactions. 

CinnamonBun is specialized for fast-typing users, as most of the interaction with the
application is through command-line, so, business owners who are familiar with using
command-line will have a great time using CinnamonBun!. 

Given below are my contributions to the project.
* **New Feature**: Add the ability to add transaction to clients.
    * Functionality: Allow the user to add transactions to clients by specifying the client,
    amount, transaction date, due date, notes, and the status of the transaction of whether it
    has been paid. 
    * Justification: This function is necessary for users to add notes about the client that may not fit into any of the other fields.
