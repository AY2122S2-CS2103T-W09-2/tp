### Project: CinnamonBun

Small business owners and freelancers may find it difficult to keep track of all their clients.

CinnamonBun is an application that helps to record and manage a large number of clients and business transactions, thus allowing business owners to focus more on their business and less on bookkeeping.

CinnamonBun comes with a beautiful Graphical User Interface (GUI) while still being optimized for control via a Command Line Interface (CLI).

### My Contributions

* **New Features**:
  * Added ability to add/remove memberships to/from clients (Pull request [\#69](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W09-2/tp/pull/69))
    * Functionality: Allow the user to add membership to a client by specifying the client and membership 
    tier (Gold,Silver,Bronze). The membership is displayed on the UI as a different color based on the tier.
    * Justification: This function allows business owners to award their clients by giving them memberships.
  * Allowed ability to find all clients by membership (Pull request [\#127](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W09-2/tp/pull/127))
    * Functionality: Allow the user to filter clients based on their membership tier, or filter all clients with a membership.
    * Justification: This function allows business owners more easily find their members.
  * Added ability to delete filtered contacts from find function or listMembers function (Pull request [\#9](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W09-2/tp/pull/9))
    * Functionality: Allow the user to delete clients based on what they have filtered from either the find function or listMembers function.
    * Justification: This function allows business owners to more easily manage their clients by removing groups of them based on filters.
